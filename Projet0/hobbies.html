        <div class="text">
            Along with coding and programming, I also have a passion for music.<br>
            For about 5 years now, I've started to compose and produce my own electronic music. Started from scratch, with no particular knowledge in music theory (only took piano lessons for a year or so).
            Turns out though that it is really something I enjoy, being able to create sounds, arrange and shape them as wanted. 
            But I also started to DJ / mix eversince i entered engineering school (my godfather was the DJ at the current time), and i discovered how satisfying it felt when you choose a track you want to put on, and see the reaction of the people on the dancefloor.

            I thought i could show you a preview of 2 songs I'm currently working on (don't mind the titles, it's still temporary):
